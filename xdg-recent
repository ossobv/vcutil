#
# Mark files as "recently used" so they show up first in the File Browser in
# GNOME/Gtk/X. This is useful when you're editing/preparing files using
# the command line and want to upload them using a (graphical) web
# brower.
#
# Usage:
#
# - <create file1.txt>
# - xdg-recent file1.txt
# - <open graphical application, click recent, see file there>
#
# Original from unix.stackexchange.com/questions/509413 by Stephen Kitt.
# Named it xdg-recent to match xdg-open, which is the other commonly used
# tool when switching from CLI to X. Not called xdg-mark-recent because
# (a) there exists a xdg-m(ime) and (b) we may want to amend this to do
# more than just "mark".
#
# Todo:
# - add -n for do-not-mark utime()
# - do other stuff, like list/delete the RecentManager data
#
# See also: xdg-open(1) from xdg-utils.
