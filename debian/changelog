    - gitbackhub: Allow force-push/deletes on "work in progress" branches.
    - indirect-scp: Document that scp -3 should work equally well.
    - psdiff: Fix python3 issue. Add "dovecot", "php-fpm", "gocollect".
    - tcpdump247: Update defaults file; add example sniffing SYN/FIN/RST.
    - uwsgi-kill: Improve matching, improve output.
    - wgrep: Don't match dirs. Do match: cc, erb, go, pp, rb, sls, yaml, yml.
  * New commands:
    - uwsgi-list: Complement uwsgi-kill.
  * Add tcpdump247 into /etc/init.d through the debian installer.
